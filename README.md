## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (recommended for compatibility)
- Conda (Anaconda/Miniconda) or pip for package management
- Optimization solver (Gurobi, CPLEX, or CBC)
- Git for version control

### Environment Setup

**Option 1: Conda Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create and activate the conda environment
conda env create -f environment/conda/environment.yml
conda activate evcsap

# Verify installation
python -c "import pyomo, geopandas, plotly; print('Environment ready!')"
```

**Option 2: Pip Virtual Environment**
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r environment/pip/requirements.txt
```

**Option 3: Docker Environment**
```bash
# Build and run container
docker build -f environment/docker/Dockerfile -t evcsap .
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/workspace evcsap

# Or use docker-compose for full development environment
docker-compose -f environment/docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [`environment/README.md`](environment/README.md).
